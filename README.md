# ScreenplayDocument
A library for manipulating screenplay documents as semantically-typed heirarchical structures.

You will be able to use this library to import a screenplay document from PDF, FDX, fountain (and possibly more) formats, for manipulation and analysis.

This will support rich annotations and metadata, such as is found in FDX files.

You will also be able to re-export the same (or modified) document to PDF, FDX, etc. with as many compatible annotations and metadata as possible.
